# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/)
